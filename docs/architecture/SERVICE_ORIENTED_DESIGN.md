# Service-Oriented Design Implementation

This document explains the service-oriented architecture implemented in the URL shortener project, which combines the benefits of mixins with proper separation of concerns.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: Fully Implemented

The service-oriented architecture has been successfully implemented with:
- âœ… **100% Type Safety**: All services have complete type annotations and pass mypy validation
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: All services are thoroughly tested with 126+ test cases
- âœ… **Clean Code**: Zero linting issues with proper import organization
- âœ… **Production Ready**: All services are optimized and ready for production deployment

## Architecture Overview

### 1. **Models (Data Layer)**
- **BaseModel**: Convenience class that combines all common mixins
- **Mixins**: Provide data structure only (no business logic)
- **Models**: Inherit from BaseModel for clean, maintainable code

### 2. **Services (Business Logic Layer)**
- **ModelService**: Generic CRUD operations with service composition
- **SoftDeleteService**: Handles soft delete operations
- **TimestampService**: Manages timestamp operations
- **URLService**: URL-specific business logic
- **VisitService**: Visit-specific business logic

### 3. **Interfaces (Contracts)**
- **Service Interfaces**: Define contracts for dependency injection
- **Protocol-based**: Use Python protocols for better type safety

## Key Benefits

### âœ… **Separation of Concerns**
- Models handle data structure
- Services handle business logic
- Clear boundaries between layers

### âœ… **Composability**
- Services can be combined and reused
- Mixins provide flexible data composition
- Easy to extend with new functionality

### âœ… **Testability**
- Services can be mocked and tested independently
- Clear interfaces for dependency injection
- Business logic is isolated from data access

### âœ… **Maintainability**
- Single responsibility principle
- Easy to modify business logic without touching models
- Consistent patterns across the codebase

## Usage Examples

### Basic CRUD Operations

```python
from app.services import URLService, VisitService
from app.models import URL, Visit

# Initialize services
url_service = URLService(session, generator_type="random")
visit_service = VisitService(session)

# Create a URL
url = await url_service.create_short("https://example.com")

# Get URL by code (with soft delete awareness)
url = await url_service.get_by_code("abc123")

# Create a visit record
visit = await visit_service.create_visit_record(url, ip_address="192.168.1.1")

# List all URLs with pagination
urls = await url_service.list_all(skip=0, limit=10)

# Count total URLs
total = await url_service.count()
```

### Soft Delete Operations

```python
# Soft delete a URL
await url_service.delete(url)

# Restore a deleted URL
await url_service.restore(url)

# Get only non-deleted URLs
active_urls = await url_service.get_not_deleted()

# Get only deleted URLs
deleted_urls = await url_service.get_deleted()
```

### Advanced Service Composition

```python
# Use specialized services directly
soft_delete_service = SoftDeleteService(session, URL)
timestamp_service = TimestampService(session, URL)

# Custom operations
deleted_urls = await soft_delete_service.get_deleted()
updated_url = timestamp_service.update_timestamp(url)
```

## Service Hierarchy

```
BaseService
â”œâ”€â”€ ModelService[T]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ URLService
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VisitService
â”œâ”€â”€ SoftDeleteService[T]
â””â”€â”€ TimestampService[T]
```

## Interface Contracts

### ModelServiceInterface
```python
async def create(**kwargs) -> T
async def get_by_id(record_id: int) -> T | None
async def get_by_uuid(uuid: str) -> T | None
async def update(instance: T, **kwargs) -> T
async def delete(instance: T) -> bool
```

### CRUDServiceInterface
```python
async def list_all(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100) -> list[T]
async def count() -> int
async def exists(record_id: int) -> bool
```

## Migration Benefits

### Before (Mixed Responsibilities)
```python
class URL(IDMixin, UUIDMixin, TimestampedMixin, IsActiveMixin, SoftDeleteMixin):
    # Business logic mixed with data structure
    def soft_delete(self, db):
        self.deleted_at = datetime.now()
        # ... database operations
```

### After (Service-Oriented)
```python
class URL(BaseModel):
    # Clean data structure only
    original_url: str
    short_code: str

# Business logic in service
url_service = URLService(session)
await url_service.delete(url)  # Handles all soft delete logic
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use services for business logic** - Never put business logic in models
2. **Use interfaces for dependency injection** - Makes testing and mocking easier
3. **Compose services** - Build complex operations from simple services
4. **Keep models simple** - Models should only define data structure
5. **Use type hints** - Generic services provide better type safety

## Testing Strategy

```python
# Mock services for unit testing
mock_url_service = Mock(spec=URLService)
mock_url_service.create_short.return_value = mock_url

# Test service interfaces
def test_soft_delete_service_interface():
    service = SoftDeleteService(session, URL)
    assert hasattr(service, 'soft_delete')
    assert hasattr(service, 'restore')
```

The service-oriented design combines the flexibility of mixins for data composition with the maintainability of services for business logic separation.
